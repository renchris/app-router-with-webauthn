  App Router With WebAuthN
</h1>

A web application that demonstrates a NextJS App Router project implementing user authentication with Passkeys using [SimpleWebAuthn](https://simplewebauthn.dev/docs/).

## ü§ù WebAuthN and NextJS

This project is a work in progress to create a working example of the implementation of Passkeys with SimpleWebAuthn in a NextJS App Router project to be used as a starting template all developers to use.

## üìö Important Libraries


- [SimpleWebAuthn](https://simplewebauthn.dev/docs/) allows for TypeScript WebAuthN integration.

- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) allows for TypeScript type-safe data modelling and database querying connection.

- [renchris' fork of the Iron Session V8 branch](https://github.com/renchris/iron-session/tree/v8-as-dependency)  allows Iron Session to be used with React Server Components and NextJS Server Actions.



## üöÄ Usage

1. **Install project dependencies.**

    Run

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

1. **Set up the Prisma database :**

    Create an `.env` file that contains the values to your database URL and secret cookie password.

    For an external database, you may set up your Prisma database with [PostgreSQL on RDS](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/setting-up-postgresql-on-rds).

    ```
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://rds-instance-username:rds-instance-password@database-name.instance-id.aws-region.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/postgres
    SECRET_COOKIE_PASSWORD=passwordpasswordpasswordpassword
    ```

    For a local file database, you may set up your Prisma databse with [SQLite](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/quickstart)

    ```
    DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
    SECRET_COOKIE_PASSWORD=passwordpasswordpasswordpassword
    ```

    If you choose to run a local database file instead, in the `schema.prisma` file, replace the provider from `"postgresql"` to `"sqlite"`

    ```diff
    datasource db {
    -   provider = "postgresql"
    +   provider = "sqlite"
        url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
    }
    ```


1. **Create the Prisma database file.**

    Remove the current migration directory and start a new migration history with prisma migrate dev
    
    Run
    ```bash
    rm -rf prisma/migrations 
    pnpm prisma migrate dev
    ```
    

1. **Run the web application.**

    Run
    ```bash
    pnpm dev
    ```

1. **Register a User.**

    Click `Register` to go to the Register page. Enter in a username and email for your passkey credential. Click Register.

    A prompt from the browser  will come up that says `Create a passkey for localhost` with your email as the passkey identifier. Click Continue.

    A prompt from the device system will come up that says `"Your Browser" is trying to verify your identity on localhost. Touch ID or enter your password to allow this.` Enter in your Touch ID.

    Your passkey will now have been registered into the database.

1. **Login the User.**

    Click `Login` to go to the Login page. Enter the email you used during the Register step. Click Login.

    A prompt from the browser will come up that says `Choose a passkey`. Click the passkey with the respective email.

    A prompt from the device system will come up that says `"Your Browser" is trying to verify your identity on localhost. Touch ID or enter your password to allow this.` Enter in your Touch ID.

    
    Your passkey credential SHOULD now have been returned as a response to be verified or not.

    HOWEVER, the current issue is that another prompt comes up saying `Use your passkey` with the options of a phone or tablet or USB security key, and not the passkey from in browser that we are using.

    This is where development is currently stuck at.

## üßê What's inside?

A quick look at the top-level files and directories where we made our feature changes in the project.

    lib
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth.ts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cookieActions.ts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database.ts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ login.ts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prisma.ts
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ register.ts
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ session.ts
    prisma
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ schema.prisma
    src
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ app
         ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ components
            ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LoginPage.tsx
            ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ RegisterPage.tsx

1. **`/lib`**: This directory will contain all of the `use server` internal functions that our components and functions will use.

1. **`lib/auth.ts`**: This file contains the functions that create or modify the data or datatype of our variables so that they can be correctly passed into our function parameters and Prisma database.

1. **`lib/cookieActions.ts`**: This file contains the functions that read and write encrypted cookies to and from cookie storage.

1. **`lib/database.ts`**: This file contains the functions that read and write data to and from our Prisma database.

1. **`lib/login.ts`**: This file contains the functions that are involved with the user log in process.

1. **`lib/prisma.ts`**: This file sets up the Prisma Client that is used by Prisma functions in the `/lib/database.ts` file.

1. **`lib/register.ts`**: This file contains the functions that are involved with the user registration process.

1. **`lib/session.ts`**: This file sets up the Iron Session object used by the session functions in the `lib/cookieAction.ts` file.

1. **`prisma.schema.ts`**: This is the configuration file that sets up Prisma with the database source type and data model definition.

1. **`/src/app`**: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of the site. `src` is a convention for ‚Äúsource code‚Äù and `app` is the convention for ‚Äúapp router‚Äù.

1. **`src/app/components/LoginPage.tsx`**: This `use client` file contains the  page component and client-side functions for the Login Page.

1. **`src/app/components/RegisterPage.tsx`**: This `use client` file contains the  page component and client-side functions for the Register Page.
